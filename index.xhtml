					<p><b><dfn><cite>The Battle for Wesnoth</cite></dfn></b> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">free and open-source</a> fantasy-themed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn-based_strategy">turn-based strategy</a> game, available for <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Microsoft Windows</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X">Apple OS X</a></strong>, and other operating systems, featuring both single-player campaigns and online or hotseat multi-player battles.</p>
					<p>Build up a great army, gradually turning raw recruits into hardened veterans to form a formidable host against which none can stand.  Choose units from a large pool of specialists, and hand-pick a force with the right strengths to fight well on diverse terrain against all manner of opposition.  Engage in a desperate struggle to reclaim the throne of Wesnoth from a usurper.  Step into the boots of a young officer sent to guard a not-so-sleepy frontier outpost.  Save your village from the undead warriors unleashed by a foul necromancer, and rescue your brother from the sorcerer’s dungeon.  Wage a brutal campaign to unite the orcish tribes.  Turn to the reviled art of necromancy to defend your home from the orcs.  Lead your people from the ruins of their meteor-wracked village in an epic quest to find a new home.  And if that’s not enough, you can easily download a wealth of <strong>community-made content</strong> from our add-ons servers.</p>
					<!-- Referring to the add-ons servers as such may be too advanced for this;
						it can of course be changed if so. -->

					<p>At the moment only the Windows package is ready. You can find it on <a href="http://wiki.wesnoth.org/Download#Development_.281.11_branch.29">the download page</a>.
